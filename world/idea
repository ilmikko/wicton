Idea:

All of the time trying to create something social in a non-social environment (that isn't interactive)
Do the ball thing again, but this time in no dimensions.
Instead, there are states for bots.
Bots can be in conversation with each other (or with a human, they don't know that though)
Bots can also be in isolation if they so wish
Bots can feel absolute bad (punish) or absolute good (reward/praise)
Rewarded actions and behaviors gain 'score'
Bots can reproduce and gain traits from one another.
Traits:
social<->isolated...
